# F1-Project
Figure out tire degradation over a stint and optimal pit windows using python

Using Carlos Sainz, Australian grand prix 2024.

Most data will be taken from Ergast Developer API

# TO DO
Put in a function that will add all lap times to multiple lists, seperated by stints/pits. For example with 2 pit stops is 3 stints so there will be three lists.
